> "The solutions all are simple... after you've already arrived at them. But they're simple only when you already know what they are."

Solution speeds:

| Day | R         | Julia        |
|-----|-----------|--------------|
| 1   | 0.046 sec | 0.003721 sec |
| 2   | 0.064 sec | 0.109703 sec |
| 3   | 0.008 sec | 0.051034 sec |
| 4   | 0.048 sec | 0.000748 sec |
| 5   | 0.008 sec | 0.001651 sec |
| 6   | 0.044 sec | 0.071909 sec |
| 7   | 8.487 sec | 0.054067 sec |
| 8   | 0.044 sec | 0.007525 sec |
| 9   | 0.265 sec | 0.002075 sec |
| 10  | 0.002 sec | 0.000193 sec |

*Excludes loading data (sometimes). R solution based on median time of 100 runs. Julia solution excludes compile time.*
